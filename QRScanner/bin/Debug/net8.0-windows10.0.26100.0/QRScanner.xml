            Manages the lifecycle, diagnostics, and scanning operations for Zebra scanners.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            <para>
            The <see cref="T:QRScanner.service.QRScannerService"/> class serves as a high-level service to control scanner devices, 
            leveraging the <see cref="F:QRScanner.service.QRScannerService.ScannerController"/> to interact with the CoreScanner SDK. 
            It provides methods for starting and stopping the scanning process, running diagnostics, 
            and handling events when a barcode or QR code is scanned.
            </para>
            <para>
            The class follows the Singleton design pattern, ensuring a single shared instance of the service. 
            It incorporates event-driven programming by exposing the <see cref="E:QRScanner.service.QRScannerService.QRCodeDecoded"/> event, 
            which propagates decoded QR or barcode data to external subscribers.
            </para>
            <para>
            To ensure proper operation, a successful diagnostics check must be performed before starting the scanning process.
            Diagnostics verify that the CoreScanner API can be opened, scanners can be detected and selected, 
            and essential settings (such as disabling scans and LEDs) can be applied. 
            </para>
            <para>
            The scanning process runs asynchronously in a background task, allowing cancellation and graceful shutdown 
            using a cancellation token. The service logs all operations for transparency and debugging purposes.

            </para>
            <para>
            The logger maintains a counter for log entries and ensures all logs include a timestamp, log level, and unique log index.
